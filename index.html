            <h1>10 Minutes School</h1>
            <p>Ayman Sadiq began the teaching profession by providing tuition to the students in different coaching at Framerate, Dhaka. But he was able to provide tuition to a little or a fixed number of students. Then he tried to extend his tuition to a large number of students who are situated in the remote corner of the country. He inspired by a poor student who comes to Dhaka from the village with little money to take coaching. The student was unable to afford the cost of Dhaka city. Then Ayman decided to launch a platform from where anyone can get lessons without any cost from the remote corner of the country. In 2014, he launched the 10 Minute School and never looked back in the career. The platform is designed to provide training in English, science, mathematics and skill development. Now he is a star in the country and achieved several international recognition.[6]
